"""POST /api/pane/permission and /api/pane/reply — the buttons that make an agent act.

A native banner's Allow / Deny answers a Claude permission dialog; its Send
and "Ask agent to fix" type a message into the pane (THI-426's rail card reuses
both). Unlike /api/send, a raw key pipe, each re-checks the pane when pressed,
because a banner can be minutes stale: Allow must only ever answer the request
its banner was shown for, and a reply must never land in a dialog, where
`1 sounds good` + Enter picks option 1, in a shell or Claude's shell mode,
where it runs, or on a half-typed draft, which Enter would submit with it.

JSON bodies only. A POST without one is a CORS "simple" request any website
could fire at localhost; application/json needs a preflight this server never
answers. FastAPI 0.136.1 already won't parse a body with no Content-Type as
JSON (`strict_content_type`, on by default), but that's a setting, and the
dependency is unpinned (older releases parsed it), so the type is checked
here too: defence in depth, and a plain 415 rather than a 422.
