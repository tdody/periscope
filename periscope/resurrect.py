"""Rewrite tmux-resurrect save files so Claude panes resume their specific
session on restore.

tmux-resurrect + continuum already restore the workspace after a reboot, and
`@resurrect-processes 'claude'` makes resurrect re-run each Claude pane's
command. But the captured command launches a FRESH session — it has no
`--resume <uuid>`. This module is invoked by resurrect's post-save-layout hook
(via `bin/periscope resurrect-rewrite`) to rewrite each Claude pane's command in
the just-written save file to `claude --resume <uuid> <its channel flags>`.

The rewrite must happen at SAVE time, while panes are live: the pane->session
map is keyed by tmux pane id, and pane ids are reassigned when the tmux server
restarts, so at restore time there is nothing left to map. The save file is the
one artifact that survives the reboot pairing each pane (by session:window.pane
position) with its command.

Two env prefixes are re-emitted here too: `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=<dir>` (which
subscription the pane bills) and `CLAUDE_WRAPPER_PROFILE=<id>` (which plugin set
the `claude` wrapper gives it). resurrect captures commands from ps argv, and a
shell-level env prefix never reaches argv — so without this a pane restores onto
the DEFAULT account, quietly billing the wrong subscription, and onto the default
profile, quietly swapping its plugin set. Emitting a prefix requires
`@resurrect-processes '~claude'` (substring match) in tmux.conf; a bare
`'claude'` anchors at the start of the command and a prefixed line would not be
restored at all.

Import discipline: stdlib only, plus `periscope.config` and
`periscope.session_status` (both stdlib-only leaves). Never import
`periscope.activity` — its imports pull in the Anthropic SDK and other
non-stdlib deps, which would break the plain-`python3` hook invocation.
This module opens its own read connection to the session DB, the same
out-of-process pattern `pane_session_hook.py` uses as the writer.

    (the pane mirror and the input client), and control-mode clients render no
